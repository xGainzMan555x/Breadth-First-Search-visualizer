# Breadth-First-Search-visualizer

####THE PROGRAM AS OF YET DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY####

Controls: 

-left mouse click -> places starting node 

-right mouse click -> places end node

-CTRL(hold) -> places obstacles onto grid

-shift(hold) -> removes nodes and obstacles from the grid

-space -> start the algorithm

About the program:

The main goal of the program is to visualize the Breadth-First-Search algorithm. It uses the OLCPixelGameEngine for the visualization. The program as of yet has some errors that restrain me from fully completing it, however, placing the nodes and obstacles works(somewhat) and the visualization for neighbour checking is added (note: there is no visualization for the shortest path). The program runs into the problem when pressing the space key for the algorithm to begin and shows "Access violation writing location" (this is when only the start and end node are placed). If the user draws obstacles the program run into an error after crossing a certain part of the grid. More specificaly, "Access violation writing location", once again.
